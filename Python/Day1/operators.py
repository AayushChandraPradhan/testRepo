# Operators
# Arithmetic,logical,Relational,Assignment,Membership,Identity

#Arithmetic
a=1
b=2
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a // b)
print(10 % 2)

#Logical(AND,OR,NOT)

#AND TT is True else False
#OR FF is false else True
#Not is opposite

print(True and True)
print(True and False)

print(True or True)
print(True or False)
print(False or False)

print(not True)
print(not False)



#Relational Operators (<,>,<=,>=,==)
print(5 > 2)  
print(10 < 1)  
print(5 >= 5)  
print(6 <= 10)  
print(5 == 5)  
print(1 != 2) 

#Membership Operatos
#in and not in are the membership operators (boolean) checks if the value is inside something
print(2 in [1,2,3])
print(5 not in [1,2,3])


#Identity Operators
#is and is not are the identity operators (boolean) can be compared with ==,!= if a or b is set of 
# arrays and both of them are null then it is false arrays ko location farak hunxa
# (Eutai memory location ma ho ki haina)
#None is always in same location so none is none is true


#Assignemnt Operator
#=,+= etc etc
